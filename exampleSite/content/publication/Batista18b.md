## Abstract
Kaldi has become a very popular toolkit for automatic speech recognition,
showing considerable improvements through the combination of hidden Markov
models (HMM) and deep neural networks (DNN). However, in spite of its great
performance for some languages (e.g. English, Italian, Serbian, etc.), the
resources for Brazilian Portuguese (BP) are still quite limited. This work
describes what appears to be the first attempt to create Kaldi-based scripts and
baseline acoustic models for BP using Kaldi tools. Experiments were carried out
for dictation tasks and a comparison to CMU Sphinx toolkit in terms of word
error rate (WER) was performed. Results seem promising, since Kaldi achieved the
absolute lowest WER of 4.75% with HMM-DNN and outperformed CMU Sphinx even when
using Gaussian mixture models only.
