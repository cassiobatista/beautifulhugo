    abstract     = "Kaldi has become a very popular toolkit for automatic speech recognition, showing considerable improvements through the combination of hidden Markov models (HMM) and deep neural networks (DNN). However, in spite of its great performance for some languages (e.g. English, Italian, Serbian, etc.), the resources for Brazilian Portuguese (BP) are still quite limited. This work describes what appears to be the first attempt to create Kaldi-based scripts and baseline acoustic models for BP using Kaldi tools. Experiments were carried out for dictation tasks and a comparison to CMU Sphinx toolkit in terms of word error rate (WER) was performed. Results seem promising, since Kaldi achieved the absolute lowest WER of 4.75% with HMM-DNN and outperformed CMU Sphinx even when using Gaussian mixture models only."

    abstract     = "An automatic speech recognition system has modules that depend on the language and, while there are many public resources for some languages (e.g., English and Japanese), the resources for Brazilian Portuguese (BP) are still limited. This work describes the development of resources and free tools for BP speech recognition, consisting of text and audio corpora, phonetic dictionary, grapheme-to-phone converter, language and acoustic models. All of them are publicly available and, together with a proposed application programming interface, have been used for the development of several new applications, including a speech module for the OpenOffice suite. Performance tests are presented, comparing the developed BP system with a commercial software. The paper also describes an application that uses synthesis and speech recognition together with a natural language processing module dedicated to statistical machine translation. This application allows the translation of spoken conversations from BP to English and vice versa. The resources make easier the adoption of BP speech technologies by other academic groups and industry.",
